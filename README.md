# 🎟️ Ticketly - Event Booking System

This is **my first dynamic website** - a complete event booking system built from scratch! Creating Ticketly has been an exciting journey where I learned to bring together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a fully functional, interactive web application.

## 🚀 Motivation
